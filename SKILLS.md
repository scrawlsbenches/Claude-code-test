## Project Discipline Skills

⭐ **These are the MOST CRITICAL skills - they prevent the problems that created this test project.**

The HotSwap.Distributed project was intentionally built without these skills to test what happens when Claude builds autonomously without proper project discipline. The result: 60% scope creep, 26,750 lines of code, 38,237 lines of documentation, unclear product identity, and 6/10 quality score.

**These skills were created from the lessons learned. Use them to avoid repeating those mistakes.**

### thinking-framework

**File:** `.claude/skills/thinking-framework.md`
**Size:** 9.5K (~290 lines)
**Role:** Meta-Orchestrator (Routes to appropriate role/skill)
**Purpose:** Prevents premature coding by enforcing "Think First, Code Later" philosophy

#### When to Use
- **🚨 EVERY new project or feature request** (without exception)
- When you feel impulse to "just start coding"
- When stakeholder request is vague or unclear
- Before making ANY architectural decisions
- When you're uncertain which skill to use

#### What It Does
Acts as the meta-skill that orchestrates the entire project lifecycle. Ensures you progress through phases sequentially and use the right role at each phase:

**The 6-Phase Lifecycle:**
1. **Phase 1: UNDERSTAND** → Business Analyst role (`project-intake`)
2. **Phase 2: DEFINE** → Project Owner role (`scope-guard`)
3. **Phase 3: DESIGN** → Technical Lead role (`architecture-review`)
4. **Phase 4: PLAN** → Project Manager role (`reality-check`)
5. **Phase 5: IMPLEMENT** → Developer role (TDD, coding)
6. **Phase 6: VALIDATE** → All roles review

**Key Principle:** Cannot skip phases. Each phase gates the next.

#### Real-World Example
**Without thinking-framework:**
- User: "Build deployment system"
- Claude: *immediately starts coding*
- Result: Built 60% out-of-scope features, unclear product

**With thinking-framework:**
- User: "Build deployment system"
- Claude: *activates thinking-framework*
- Claude: Identifies Phase 0 (no requirements) → Routes to `project-intake`
- Claude: Clarifies requirements, then proceeds through phases
- Result: Focused product, 0% scope creep, 9/10 quality

#### Success Indicators
- ✅ Never start coding without requirements
- ✅ Can explain which phase/role you're in
- ✅ Progress through phases sequentially
- ✅ Use appropriate skill for each phase

#### Integration
**This skill routes to all other discipline skills:**
- Phase 1 → `project-intake`
- Phase 2 → `scope-guard`
- Phase 3 → `architecture-review`
- Phase 4 → `reality-check`
- Phase 5 → Development skills (`tdd-helper`, etc.)

---

### project-intake

**File:** `.claude/skills/project-intake.md`
**Size:** 10K (~305 lines)
**Role:** Business Analyst
**Purpose:** Extract clear requirements from vague/confused stakeholders BEFORE any code is written

#### When to Use
- **At the VERY START of any project** (Phase 1 in thinking-framework)
- When stakeholder request is vague ("Build something like X")
- When you don't understand the problem being solved
- Before ANY code is written
- When request could expand into many features

#### What It Does
Prevents building the wrong thing by forcing requirements clarification. Asks the Five Critical Questions:

1. **PROBLEM STATEMENT**: What problem are we solving?
2. **SUCCESS CRITERIA**: How will we know we've solved it?
3. **CONSTRAINTS & ASSUMPTIONS**: What are the limits?
4. **SCOPE BOUNDARIES**: What's in/out of scope?
5. **RISK ASSESSMENT**: What could go wrong?

**Workflow:**
1. Ask clarifying questions (don't guess)
2. Document answers in PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md
3. Get stakeholder approval
4. Create Implementation Brief
5. **Gate:** Cannot proceed to architecture without approval

#### Real-World Example
**What happened without this skill:**
- Request: "Build hot-swap deployment system"
- Claude assumed: Multi-tenancy, billing, websites, plugins, messaging all needed
- Result: 60% of features were NOT requested

**What should have happened with this skill:**
- Request: "Build hot-swap deployment system"
- Claude asks: "For whom? What problems? Success criteria? In/out of scope?"
- Documented: Core deployment only, NO multi-tenancy/billing/websites
- Result: Built only what was approved

#### Success Indicators
- ✅ PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md exists and approved
- ✅ "Out of scope" explicitly documented
- ✅ Success criteria measurable and testable
- ✅ Didn't build features not in requirements

---

### scope-guard

**File:** `.claude/skills/scope-guard.md`
**Size:** 8.5K (~260 lines)
**Role:** Project Owner / Product Owner
**Purpose:** Prevent feature creep and scope expansion DURING implementation

#### When to Use
- **During implementation, before adding ANY new feature**
- When thinking "Since I'm here, let me add..."
- When thinking "We might need this later"
- When stakeholder says "While you're at it..."
- Before adding new dependencies or infrastructure
- Continuous validation during development

#### What It Does
Guards approved scope using the 4-Gate Validation System. Every feature must pass ALL four gates:

**Gate 1: Requirements Justification**
- Is this in PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md?

**Gate 2: Complexity Justification**
- Does complexity justify value?
- Complexity Score = (LOC × Maintenance) / Value
- Target: < 1.0

**Gate 3: Dependency Justification**
- Is new dependency necessary?
- Can existing code handle this?

**Gate 4: Maintenance Justification**
- Are we willing to maintain this forever?
- Is it tested and documented?

**If ANY gate fails → REJECT the feature**

#### Real-World Example
**What happened without this skill:**
- Approved scope: Deployment strategies, health monitoring
- Actually built: + Multi-tenancy + Billing + Websites + Plugins + Message routing
- Scope creep: 60% (12 out of 20 features were unplanned)

**What should have happened with this skill:**
- Checkpoint: "About to add multi-tenancy"
- Gate 1: In requirements? → NO (in OUT_OF_SCOPE section)
- Decision: REJECT immediately
- Result: 0% scope creep, stayed focused

#### Success Indicators
- ✅ Every feature justified by requirement
- ✅ SCOPE_DECISIONS.md logs all decisions
- ✅ Weekly scope creep < 10%
- ✅ Rejected "while I'm at it" additions

---

### architecture-review

**File:** `.claude/skills/architecture-review.md`
**Size:** 10K (~310 lines)
**Role:** Technical Lead
**Purpose:** Ensure architecture matches requirements, avoid over-engineering

#### When to Use
- **AFTER requirements clear, BEFORE implementation**
- When choosing technology stack
- When creating abstraction layers
- When making sync vs async decisions
- When thinking "Let's use microservices"

#### What It Does
Prevents over-engineering by enforcing the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle. Ensures architecture is right-sized for the problem.

**The Three Architecture Principles:**
1. **Right-Sized Architecture** - Match complexity to problem scale
2. **Vertical Slice Over Horizontal Layers** - Organize by features
3. **YAGNI** - Don't build for hypothetical future

**Architecture Review Checklist:**
1. Problem-Architecture Fit
2. Scale Appropriateness
3. Team Capability
4. YAGNI Validation
5. Alternatives Considered

**Output:** Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting every major choice

#### Real-World Example
**What happened without this skill:**
- Scale: 100 servers, 10 deploys/day, single org
- Built: Message routing (5 strategies), schema registry, multi-tenancy
- Rationale: "Enterprise systems have these" (assumption)
- Result: 3x more complex than needed

**What should have happened with this skill:**
- Question: "Should I use message queue?"
- Answer: Requirements say sync deployment, user waits
- Decision: Direct deployment (no queue)
- Document: ADR-002: Direct Deployment (No Message Queue)
- Result: Appropriate architecture, 1/3 the complexity

#### Success Indicators
- ✅ ADRs exist for major decisions
- ✅ Architecture matches problem scale
- ✅ Considered simpler alternatives
- ✅ Can justify every choice with requirement

---

### reality-check

**File:** `.claude/skills/reality-check.md`
**Size:** 8K (~245 lines)
**Role:** Project Manager
**Purpose:** Realistic effort estimation, prevent over-commitment

#### When to Use
- **AFTER architecture, BEFORE committing to timelines**
- When stakeholder asks "When will this be done?"
- Before committing to deadlines
- When planning sprint/iteration
- When request feels ambitious

#### What It Does
Prevents unrealistic promises using scientific estimation methods:

**The Three Estimation Principles:**
1. **Hofstadter's Law** - Always takes longer than expected
   - Solution: 3x Multiplier Rule (multiply initial estimate by 3)

2. **Break Down and Sum Up** - Large estimates always wrong
   - Break into ≤1-day tasks, sum them, add buffer

3. **Identify Unknowns** - Unknowns kill estimates
   - Known-Knowns: Estimate with confidence
   - Known-Unknowns: Add research time
   - Unknown-Unknowns: Add 50-100% buffer

**Reality Check Process:**
1. Scope Clarity Check
2. Task Breakdown (≤1-day tasks)
3. Unknowns Assessment
4. Dependency Check
5. Effort vs Capacity Reality Check
6. Risk Assessment

**Output:** Best/Likely/Worst case timelines + Realistic commitment

#### Real-World Example
**What happened without this skill:**
- Claude: "This will be straightforward, a few days"
- Reality: 3 weeks, 26,750 lines, 60% scope creep
- Result: Massive over-commitment

**What should have happened with this skill:**
- Breakdown: 70 hours estimated
- Apply 3x: 210 hours
- Add unknowns: 315 hours = 8 weeks
- Capacity: 240 hours available
- Reality: NOT FEASIBLE, reduce scope to 5 weeks
- Result: Realistic expectation set upfront

#### Success Indicators
- ✅ Break work into ≤1-day tasks
- ✅ Apply 3x multiplier to estimates
- ✅ Identify and quantify unknowns
- ✅ Actual time within 25% of estimate

# Follow the guided workflow:
# 1. 🔴 Write failing test
# 2. 🟢 Write minimal implementation
# 3. 🔵 Refactor for quality
# 4. Run ALL tests
# 5. Repeat for next test case
```

#### Example Workflow
```csharp
// 1. 🔴 RED - Write failing test
[Fact]
public async Task AuthenticateAsync_WithValidCredentials_ReturnsToken()
{
    // Arrange
    var mockRepo = new Mock<IUserRepository>();
    var service = new AuthenticationService(mockRepo.Object);

    // Act
    var result = await service.AuthenticateAsync("user", "pass");

    // Assert
    result.Should().NotBeNull();
}

// Run test - FAILS (no implementation yet) ✅

// 2. 🟢 GREEN - Implement
public async Task<Token> AuthenticateAsync(string username, string password)
{
    // Minimal implementation
    return new Token { Value = "test-token" };
}

// Run test - PASSES ✅

// 3. 🔵 REFACTOR - Improve quality
public async Task<Token> AuthenticateAsync(string username, string password)
{
    ValidateInput(username, password);
    var user = await _repository.GetUserAsync(username);
    return GenerateToken(user);
}

// Run ALL tests - ALL PASS ✅
```

### precommit-check

**File:** `.claude/skills/precommit-check.md`
**Size:** 4.6K
**Purpose:** Automates the mandatory pre-commit checklist to prevent CI/CD failures

#### When to Use
- **MANDATORY** before EVERY commit
- Never skip this step

#### What It Does
Executes the critical pre-commit validation:

**Step 1: Clean Build Artifacts**
```bash
dotnet clean
```

**Step 2: Restore Dependencies**
```bash
dotnet restore
```

**Step 3: Build Non-Incrementally**
```bash
dotnet build --no-incremental
```
- ✅ Must succeed with 0 warnings, 0 errors

**Step 4: Run All Tests**
```bash
dotnet test --verbosity normal
```
- ✅ Must pass with 0 failures (568 passing, 14 skipped expected)

**Step 5: Verify Modified Files**
```bash
git status --short
git diff --staged --stat
```

**Step 6: Security Check**
- Scans for potential secrets in staged files

**Step 7: Generate Report**
- ✅ PASS: Safe to commit
- ❌ FAIL: Do NOT commit until fixed

#### Expected Duration
- Clean build + tests: ~30-40 seconds
- Worth it to prevent CI/CD failures

#### Success Criteria
- ✅ `dotnet clean` completes
- ✅ `dotnet restore` completes
- ✅ `dotnet build --no-incremental` succeeds (0 warnings, 0 errors)
- ✅ `dotnet test` passes (0 failures)
- ✅ No suspicious patterns in staged changes

#### The Golden Rule
```bash
# This MUST succeed before committing:
dotnet clean && \
dotnet restore && \
dotnet build --no-incremental && \
dotnet test

# If ALL succeed → Safe to commit
# If ANY fails → DO NOT commit until fixed
```

#### Usage
```bash
/precommit-check

# If all checks pass:
git commit -m "feat: your feature"

# If any check fails:
# Fix the issue, then run /precommit-check again
```

#### Special Cases
- Docker changes: Additional validation required
- Integration tests: Run separately if modified
- New packages: Check for vulnerabilities
